        <h2 class="topic">Polonnaruwa</h2>
    <p class="p">The beautiful island of Sri Lanka is a famous tourist destination for people across the world. A small island with beautiful 
        beaches and the lush scenery is truly a traveler&apos;s paradise. But there are others things also apart from the beaches and scenery that attracts
         people from around the world. The traditional essence of the true Sri Lankan culture can be found in the small towns and villages of 
         Sri Lanka. One such place is Polonnaruwa. Let us check out the Places to visit in Polonnaruwa that reflects the true Sri Lankan culture 
         and heritage.
    </p>

    <h2 class="h">1. The Royal Palace</h2>
      <img src="images/Royal Palace3.jpg"  class="pic" alt="Royal Palace">
    <p class="p">
        On a visit to the Polonnaruwa Heritage City, the Royal Palace is a never miss attraction on the trip. This Royal Palace of the great King 
        Parakumba (1153-1186 ) had been constructed as a seven-story building. It took the construction around seven years and seven months to be
         completed. Out of the 7 stories having 1000 rooms, only 3 stories with 55 rooms are remaining. The Palace had been destroyed by an invader
          from south Indian named &quot;;Maga.&quot;</p>
  </div>
   
  <div>
    <h2 class="h">2. The Shiva Devale No. 2</h2>
      <img src="images/Shiva Devale 1.jpg"  class="pic" alt="Shiva Devale">
    <p class="p">
        The Shiva Devale No. 2 is considered to be the oldest building in the city of Polonnaruwa as it dates way back to the South Indian 
        Chola dynasty period when the Indian invaders had established this city. Unlike many of the buildings of the Ancient City of Polonnaruwa,
         it had been created entirely of stone. Due to this reason, the structure today is in a much similar condition as it was when it was built 
         centuries ago. The statue of Lord Shiva&apos;s mount, Nandi the bull is something to watch out for.
    </p>

    <h2 class="h">3. The Audience Halle</h2>
      <img src="images/The Audience Halle.jpg"  class="pic" alt="Audience Halle3">
    <p class="p">
        The Audience Hall is a monument having beautiful stone carved elephants alongside each of its walls. Parakramabahu I&apos;s Audience Hall
         is popular for the array of elephants. All of the carved elephants look different from each another. The steps to the entrance of the 
         Audience Hall are pretty impressive, with some beautiful lions at the top of each of the side.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h2 class="h">4. The Sacred Quadrangle</h2>
      <img src="images/The Sacred Quadrangle3.webp"  class="pic" alt="Sacred Quadrangle">
    <p class="p">
        This sacred quadrangle has a number of significant sacred monuments. It is a representation of the grandest architecture of the Ancient 
        city of Polonnaruwa during that period. The extremely eye-catching scene of the entire quadrangle is believed to be the circular Vatadage.
         Four large Buddha statues surround the middle of the shrine.
    </p>

  <div>
    <h2 class="h">5. The Swimming Pool</h2>
      <img src="images/The Swimming Pool3.jpg"  class="pic" alt="Swimming Pool">
    <p class="p">
        The swimming pool is situated at the corner of the palace grounds. There are some crocodile-mouth spouts which direct the fresh water 
        into the pool. It is one of the main attractions of the ancient city of Polonnaruwa. It is ideal to visit it in the evening owing to the 
        warm weather.

<h2 class="h">6. The Dagaba Kiri Vihara</h2>
<img src="images/The Dagaba Kiri Vihara2.jpg"  class="pic" alt="Kiri Vihara">
<p class="p">
    The term Kiri Vihara means “milk-white”. This large stupa is lying north of Lankathilaka Pilima Ge. It had been created by a queen of the
     great king Parakramabahu (1153-1186) named “Subadra”. The original lime plaster is in the perfect white condition even after almost 700 
     years of it being created. It is said to be the best-preserved unrestored dagaba of the Polonnaruwa city. The first traditional name of 
     the stupa was “Rupavathi Stupa”. It is a part of the Ãlahana Privena and it stands at 80 feet in height today.
</div>

<div>
<h2 class="h">7. The Pabalu Vehera</h2>
<img src="images/The Pabalu Vehera1.webp"  class="pic" alt="Pabalu Vehera">
<p class="p">
    This is the third largest dagaba of the Ancient Polonnaruwa city and it is in excellent condition. The origin of this uniquely shaped Pabalu
     Vehera stupa is yet to be discovered. It has been built by a consort of the king great Parakramabahu ( 1153-1186 AD). This stupa is currently
      called by the name of “Pabalu” which means beads. This is due to the reason that a large number of glass beads had been found at the time of
       the excavation of the area near to the stupa. The top, as well as the center parts of the stupa, have been destroyed by the invaders and
        treasure hunters just recently.

<h2 class="h">8. The Buddha statue at Lankatilaka</h2>
<img src="images/The Buddha statue at Lankatilaka3.jpg"  class="pic" alt="Lankatilaka">
<p class="p">
    The Lankatilaka Vihara is said to be one of the emblematic structures of an ancient kingdom of the city of Polonnaruwa. Two great walls 
    created a narrow aisle that led the way to a very impressive, headless Buddha statue is still standing. The height of the statue is almost 
    over 14m high. It was built by the great King Parakramabahu.
</p>

<div>

<img src="images/Lord Buddha figures at Gal Vihara2.jpg"  class="pic" alt="Gal Vihara">
<p class="p">
    This is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It is the perfect specimen of Lord Buddha statue created with solid stone. It was built during the 
    reign of the great King Parakramabahu (1153-1186 A.C). The reclining Buddha sculpture is 14 m long, which represents Buddha entering the 
    Nirvana stage. The sculptor artist of the Gal Vihara possessed a great deal of skill and expertise in the field of stone sculpture in the 
    land of Sri Lanka.

<img src="images/The Rankot Vihara3.jpg"  class="pic" alt="Rankot Vihara">
<p class="p">
    The Rankot Vihara stupa had been created by Nissanka Malla of the ancient city of Polonnaruwa. He had ruled the country for almost a decade 
    from 1187 to 1196. The Rankoth Vehera have been created keeping in mind the old tradition of the Anuradhapura Maha Viharaya. It has an 
    impressive height of 54 meters. The stone inscription near to the stupa describes it to be known as “Ruwanweli”.

<div>
    <h2 class="h">11. Polonnaruwa Tank</h2>
    <img src="images/Polonnaruwa Tank3.JPG"  class="pic" alt="Polonnaruwa Tank">
    <p class="p">
        The tank is believed to be an ancient reservoir of water for the city. The country of Sri Lanka is full of a variety of tanks. 
        The ancient city of Polonnaruwa is situated on the banks of the Topa Tank. The tank is a beautiful location for sightseeing. The 
        tank is raised up from the town so one only see it if one walks towards it.    </p>
