        enclosed with a dense wilderness. The jungle around the monastery infested with wild animals let the 
        pleasance remain silent for thousands of years in the rural Digamadulla area. It enlisted in the 
        least-known historic places in Sri Lanka.

        lying on a floor. Hence, occupied by the name, Buddhangala. The monastery has been abandoned over 
        centuries due to the transpose of Kingdoms in old Sri Lanka. It wasn&apos;t even documented until if found 
        in 1964 by a young monk who traveled along the dene. After founding the ruins of the monastery, he has 
        cleared the surrounding into a fairer level together with another monk. Years later, the monastery became
         popular as the ancient relics emerged through the excavation. Carefully enshrined golden lotus flowers, 
         a gold casket was found through excavation which are believed to be consecrated by a private donor. The 
         casket is believed to be created in the 5th century according to the characteristics of the outer golden 
         plates. Years later, in 1974, there had been built a bell-shaped new Sthupa by the former president, 
         William Gopallawa. But, once again it faced a darker period in the civil war of Sri Lanka with terrorism.
          Until then, it remains quiet and unpopular without the considerable attention of the government up to now.
