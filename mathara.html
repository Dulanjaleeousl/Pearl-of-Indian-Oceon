    <h2 class="topic">Mathara</h2>
    <p class="p">
        Matara is a busy town booming with commercial activities. Situated 160 kilometers from the Sri Lankan 
        capital of Colombo, the coastal town may not feature highly on the lists of tourists. The high rise 
        buildings housing some of the leading multinational companies may not seem like an attractive tourist 
        landmark in Matara. However, that does not mean that Matara holds next to negligible tourist value. The 
        Nilwala River cuts through the city of Matara forming stunning views along its path. The river falls into 
        the Indian Ocean at Totamuna. Additionally, the beachfront paints beautiful scenes along the coast of the
         city.
    </p>

    <h2 class="h">1. Star Fort</h2>
    <img src="images/Star Fort.webp" alt="Star Fort" class="pic">
    <p class="p">
        As the name suggests, the Star Fort is constructed in the shape of a star. It was built by the Dutch to 
        prevent attacks from external enemies. The fort is composed out of 6-points forming a star which has a 
        point facing every direction. Each point is bolstered with two large canons. Still protected from all 
        sides by a deep moat, the Star Fort houses a well in the center that offered water within the territories. 
        Additionally, two prisons are also present within the forts premises. It was later occupied by the British 
        to carry out administrative work. The Fort stands even to this day as a remnant of colonialism in Sri Lanka.
    </p>
  
    <h2 class="h">2. Old Dutch Trade Center</h2>
    <img src="images/Old Dutch Trade Center.webp" alt=" Old Dutch Trade Center" class="pic">
    <p class="p">
        Architectural buffs will be mesmerized with the T-shaped Old Dutch Trade Center. Located on the 
        western section of the town, it was once the town's market bustling with trade activities. Composed 
        of steep, imposing roofs and conical towers, the Old Dutch Trade Center still stands to this day in 
        its grandiose. The open-sided structure is supported by wooden beams and columns, while a majestic 
        entrance greets the visitors. The roof is latticed with clay tiles, locally known as Peti Ulu. It also 
        bears British architectural influences with its decorated, whitewashed columns.
    </p>

    <h2 class="h">3. Weherahena Temple</h2>
    <img src="images/Weherahena Temple.webp" alt="Weherahena Temple" class="pic">
    <p class="p">
        The Weherahena Temple is located on the eastern part of the town of Matara. The temple contains an 
        artificial cave, which stands decorated with scenes from the life of Buddha. The pathways of the 
        Weherahena Temple lead to a colorful, gigantic Buddha statue towering over 25 meters height. As 
        picturesque as the spot may be, photography is strictly prohibited within the temple. A procession 
        of dancers and trained elephants celebrate the anniversary of the founding of the temple during 
        late-November or early December. 
    </p>

    <h2 class="h">4. Polhena Beach</h2>
    <img src="images/Polhena Beach.webp" alt="Polhena Beach" class="pic">
    <p class="p">
        The beaches in Matara are not very touristy. However, the Polhena Beach stands as an exception to the rule.
         The Polhena Beach may be hard to access, but it is worth all the navigation. Situated at a distance of 2 
         kilometers from the Matara City Center, the Polhena Beach has calm waters calling out visitors for a swim. 
         The offshore coral reefs break the waves offering a serene sandy cove along the coast. Due to the romantic
          atmosphere of Polhena Beach, it enjoys the position of a popular honeymoon destination. It also acts as a
           weekend getaway for the locals.
    </p>

    <h2 class="h">5. Crow Island</h2>
    <img src="images/Crow Island.webp" alt="Crow Island" class="pic">
    <p class="p">
        IThe Crow Island is located right across Polhena Beach, where the Nilwala Ganga River meets the 
        Indian Ocean. Covered in lush green and wilderness, walking tracks, mangrove plantations, and 
        freshwater lakes, the island carries great aesthetic value and is one of the most beautiful places 
        in Sri Lanka. The island hosts a mix of ecosystems. Locals often scout to the Crow Island Beach Park 
        to spend time with their kids and other family members. The Crow Island Beach Park contains an array 
        of parks, rides, and play areas that are perfect for unwinding. The sea along Crow Island is choppy 
        and hence is not suitable for swimming or bathing.
    </p>
  
    <h2 class="h">6. Dondra Head Lighthouse</h2>
    <img src="images/Dondra Head Lighthouse.webp" alt="Dondra Head Lighthouse" class="pic">
    <p class="p">
        The Dondra Lighthouse is located at the Dondra Head on the southern tip of the Sri Lankan island.
         Touching a height of 160 feet, it is the tallest lighthouse in the entirety of Sri Lanka! The
          whitewashed monolith can be seen from every direction. Conceptualized by Sir James Nicholas Douglass,
          the structure is built in stone, which was imported from Cornwall and Scotland. The octagonal brick 
          tower has a spiral staircase traveling to the top-most floor. The balcony offers the panoramic views
           including that of the Indian Ocean in the South and the Bulutota Mountain Range in the North.
    </p>

    <h2 class="h">7. Matara Paravi Duwa Temple</h2>
    <img src="images/Matara Paravi Duwa Temple.webp" alt="Matara Paravi Duwa Templeh" class="pic">
    <p class="p">
        Situated on a small island. Matara Paravai Duwa Temple is a Buddhist temple that is as scenic as it is 
        peaceful. Surrounded by the ocean, Matara Paravi Duwa Temple is home to Buddhist monks and ideal for 
        soul seeking. You may find monks crossing the bridge and going inside the temple. You are requested to 
        maintain silence and decorum at all times during your visit. The sound of crashing waves feels like a
         piece of meditative music to the ears. If you want to get away from all the hustle-bustle and flee to 
         tranquil surroundings, then you should come to this place.
    </p>

    <h2 class="h">8. Matara Beach</h2>
    <img src="images/Matara Beach.webp" alt="Matara Beach" class="pic">
    <p class="p">
        One of the best places to visit in Matara is the beach itself. Unlike other popular beaches in Sri Lanka, 
        you will not find much crowd at this place. So, enjoy taking long walks by the shore, go beach combing, or
         just sit under a tree and read your favorite book gazing at the ocean once in a while. Undoubtedly, Matara
          Beach is one of the best beaches in Sri Lanka. When the ride is not strong, you can also enjoy taking a 
          bath in the sea.
    </p>

    <h2 class="h">9. Medawatta Beach</h2>
    <img src="images/Medawatta Beach.webp" alt=" Medawatta Beach" class="pic">
    <p class="p">
