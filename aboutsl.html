            <div class="imagetext">
              <h1 class="topic2">Sri Lanka</h1>
            <p>Sri Lanka is formerly known as Ceylon, and officially the Democratic Socialist 
            Republic of Sri Lanka,is an island country in South Asia. It lies in the Indian Ocean, southwest of the <br>Bay of Bengal, and southeast 
            of the Arabian Sea; it is separated from the Indian subcontinent by the Gulf of Mannar and the Palk Strait. Sri Lanka shares a 
            maritime border with India and the Maldives. Sri Jayawardenepura Kotte is its legislative capital, and Colombo is its largest 
            city and financial centre.<br>
            </p>
      
            <p>Sri Lanka's documented history goes back 3,000 years, with evidence of prehistoric human settlements that dates to at least 125,000 
            years ago. It has a rich cultural heritage.<br> The earliest known Buddhist writings of Sri Lanka, known collectively as the Pāli 
            canon, date to the fourth Buddhist council, which took place in 29 BCE. Sri Lanka's geographic location and deep harbours 
            have made it of great strategic importance, from the earliest days of the ancient Silk Road trade route to today's so-called maritime 
            Silk Road. Because its location made it a major trading hub, it was already known to both Far Easterners and Europeans as 
            long ago as the Anuradhapura period. The country's trade in luxury goods and<br> spices attracted traders of many nations, which helped 
            to create Sri Lanka's diverse population. During a period of great political crisis in the Sinhalese kingdom of Kotte,<br> the Portuguese 
            arrived in Sri Lanka (largely by accident) and then sought to control the island's maritime regions and its lucrative external trade. 
            Part of Sri Lanka became a<br> Portuguese possession. After the Sinhalese-Portuguese war, the Dutch and the Kingdom of Kandy took control 
            of those areas. The Dutch possessions were then taken by the<br> British, who later extended their control over the whole island, 
            colonising it from 1815 to 1948. A national movement for political independence arose in the early 20th century,<br> and in 1948, 
            Ceylon became a dominion. The dominion was succeeded by the republic named Sri Lanka in 1972. Sri Lanka's more recent history was 
            marred by a 26-year civil war, which began in 1983 and ended decisively in 2009; when the Sri Lanka Armed Forces defeated the 
            Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam.<br>
            </p>
      
            <p>Today, Sri Lanka is a multinational state, home to diverse cultures, languages, and ethnicities. The Sinhalese are the majority of 
            the nation's population. The Tamils, who are a large minority group, have also played an influential role in the island's history. 
            Other long established groups include the Moors, the Burghers, the Malays, the Chinese, and the indigenous Vedda.<br>
            </p>
      
            <p>The island has had a long history of engagement with modern international groups: it is a founding member of the SAARC and a member of the 
            United Nations, the<br> Commonwealth of Nations, the G77, and the Non-Aligned Movement.<br>
            </p>
      
           <p>Sri Lanka is the highest ranked South Asian nation on the Human Development Index, and has the second highest per capita income in South Asia.

              <h1 class="topic2">History of Sri Lanka</h1>
            <p>The history of Sri Lanka is intertwined with the history of the broader Indian subcontinent and the surrounding regions, 
                comprising the areas of South Asia, Southeast Asia and Indian Ocean.<br><br>
                The early human remains found on the island of Sri Lanka date to about 38,000 years ago (Balangoda Man).<br><br>
                The historical period begins roughly in the 3rd century, based on Pali chronicles like the Mahavansa, Deepavansa, and the 
                Choolavansa. They describe the history since the arrival of Sinhalese from Northern India The earliest documents 
                of settlement in the Island are found in these chronicles. These chronicles cover the period since the establishment of the
                 Kingdom of Tambapanni in the 6th century BCE by the earliest ancestors of the Sinhalese. The first Sri Lankan ruler of the 
                 Anuradhapura Kingdom, Pandukabhaya, is recorded for the 4th century BCE. Buddhism was introduced in the 3rd century BCE by 
                 Arhath Mahinda (son of the Indian emperor Ashoka).<br><br>
                The island was divided into numerous kingdoms over the following centuries, intermittently (between CE 993&hyphen;1077) united under 
                Chola rule. Sri Lanka was ruled by 181 monarchs from the Anuradhapura to Kandy periods. [unreliable source?] From the 16th 
                century, some coastal areas of the country were also controlled by the Portuguese, Dutch and British. Between 1597 and 1658, 
                a substantial part of the island was under Portuguese rule. The Portuguese lost their possessions in Ceylon due to Dutch 
                intervention in the Eighty Years' War. Following the Kandyan Wars, the island was united under British rule in 1815. Armed 
                uprisings against the British took place in the 1818 Uva Rebellion and the 1848 Matale Rebellion. Independence was finally 
                granted in 1948 but the country remained a Dominion of the British Empire until 1972.<br><br>
                In 1972 Sri Lanka assumed the status of a Republic. A constitution was introduced in 1978 which made the Executive President 
                the head of state. The Sri Lankan Civil War began in 1983, including Insurrections in 1971 and 1987, with the 25-year-long 
                civil war ending in 2009. There was an attempted coup in 1962 against the government under Sirimavo Bandaranaike.

              <h1 class="topic2">Geography of Sri Lanka</h1>
            <p>Sri Lanka, formerly called "Ceylon", is an island nation in the Indian Ocean, southeast of the Indian subcontinent, in a strategic
                 location near major Indian Ocean sea lanes. The nation has a total area of 65,610 square kilometres (25,330 sq mi), with 
                 64,630 square kilometres (24,950 sq mi) of land and 980 square kilometres (380 sq mi) of water. Its coastline is 1,340 kilometres
                  (830 mi) long. The main island of Sri Lanka has an area of 65,268 km2; it is the twenty-fifth largest island of the world by area.
                  Dozens of offshore islands account for the remaining 342 km2 area.[citation needed] The largest offshore island, Mannar Island, 
                  leads to Adam's Bridge.
               Adam's Bridge, a land connection to the Indian mainland, is now mostly submerged with only a chain of limestone shoals remaining 
               above sea level. According to temple records, this natural causeway was formerly complete, but was breached by a violent storm 
               (probably a cyclone) in 1480.[citation needed] The formation is also known as Rama's Bridge, as according to Hindu mythology, 
               it was constructed during the rule of Lord Rama.[citation needed]
               Sri Lanka's climate includes tropical monsoons: the northeast monsoon (December to March), and the southwest monsoon 
               (June to October). Its terrain is mostly low, flat to rolling plain, with mountains in the south-central interior. 
               The highest point is Pidurutalagala at 2,524 m (8,281 ft). Natural resources include limestone, graphite, mineral sands, 
               gems, phosphates, clay. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geography_of_Sri_Lanka" class="readmore">Read More...</a>

              <h1 class="topic2">Government and Politics of Sri Lanka</h1>
            <p>Sri Lanka is a democratic republic and a unitary state which is governed by a semi-presidential system, with a mixture of a 
                presidential system and a parliamentary system. Sri Lanka is the oldest democracy in Asia. Most provisions of the constitution 
                can be amended by a two-thirds majority in parliament. The amendment of certain basic features such as the clauses on language, 
                religion, and reference to Sri Lanka as a unitary state require both a two-thirds majority and approval in a nationwide referendum.<br><br>
                Sri Lanka is a semi-presidential representative democratic republic, whereby the President of Sri Lanka is both head of state 
                and head of government, and it relies on a multi-party system. Executive power is exercised by the President on the advice of 
                the Prime Minister and the Cabinet of Ministers. Legislative power is vested in the Parliament. For decades, the party system 
                was dominated by the socialist Sri Lanka Freedom Party and the conservative United National Party. The Judiciary is independent
                 of the executive and the legislature. The politics of Sri Lanka reflect the historical and political differences between the 
                 three main ethnic groups, the Sinhala majority and the Tamil and Muslim minorities, who are concentrated in the north and east
                  of the island. <br><br>
                The current political culture in Sri Lanka is a contest between two rival coalitions led by the centre-left and progressive 
                United People's Freedom Alliance (UPFA), an offspring of Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP), and the comparatively right-wing and
                 pro-capitalist United National Party (UNP). Sri Lanka is essentially a multi-party democracy with many smaller Buddhist,
                  socialist and Tamil nationalist political parties. As of July 2011, the number of registered political parties in the country
                   is 67. Of these, the Lanka Sama Samaja Party (LSSP), established in 1935, is the oldest.

              <h1 class="topic2">Economy of Sri Lanka</h1>
            <p>TThe free-market economy of Sri Lanka was worth $84 billion by nominal gross domestic product (GDP) in 2019 and $296.959 billion 
                by purchasing power parity (PPP). The country had experienced an annual growth of 6.4 percent from 2003 to 2012, well above 
                its regional peers. This growth was driven by the growth of non-tradable sectors, which the World Bank warned to be both 
                unsustainable and unequitable. Growth has slowed since then. In 2019 with an income per capita of 13,620 PPP Dollars
                 or 3,852 (2019) nominal US dollars, Sri Lanka was re-classified as a lower middle income nation by the World Bank from a 
                 previous upper middle income status.<br><br>
                Sri Lanka has met the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) target of halving extreme poverty and is on track to meet most of the 
                other MDGs, outperforming other South Asian countries. Sri Lanka's poverty head count index was 4.1% by 2016. Since the end of 
                the three-decade-long Sri Lankan Civil War, Sri Lanka has begun focusing on long-term strategic and structural development 
                challenges. It strives to transition to an upper middle income country. Sri Lanka also faces challenges in social inclusion, 
                governance and sustainability.<br><br>
                Services accounted for 58.2% of Sri Lanka's economy in 2019 up from 54.6% in 2010, industry 27.4% up from 26.4% a decade earlier 
                and agriculture 7.4%. Though there is a competitive export agricultural sector, technological advances have been slow to enter 
                the protected domestic sector. Sri Lanka is the largest solid and industrial tyres manufacturing centre in the world and has an 
                apparel sector which is moving up the value chain. But rising trade protection over the past decade has also caused concern over 
                the resurgence of inward looking policies.<br><br>
                In services, ports and airports are helping the country's newfound status as a shipping and aviation hub. Port of Colombo is 
                the largest transshipment hub in South Asia. There is a growing software and information technology sector, which is 
                competitive and is open to global competition. Tourism is a fast expanding area. Lonely Planet named Sri Lanka the 
                best destination to visit in 2019 and Travel+Leisure the best island. Sri Lanka's top export destinations are the United 
                States, United Kingdom and India. China, India and the UAE are the main import partners.<br><br>
                With the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, lingering concerns over Sri Lanka's slowing growth, money printing and government 
                debt has spilled over into a series of sovereign rating downgrades. Import controls and import substitution have 
                intensified after heightened monetary instability coming from debt monetization. Sri Lanka has been named 
                among the top 10 countries in the world in its handling of the COVID-19 pandemic.

              <h1 class="topic2">Transportation of Sri Lanka</h1>
            <p>Transport in Sri Lanka is based on its road network, which is centred on the country's commercial capital Colombo. A rail 
                network handles a portion of Sri Lanka's transport needs. There are navigable waterways, harbours and three international 
                airports: in Katunayake, 35 kilometres (22 mi) north of Colombo, in Hambantota, and in Jaffna. <br><br>
                Roads account for about 93 percent of Sri Lanka's land transport. In October 2013, there were 12,000 kilometres (7,500 mi) 
                of A- and B-class roads and 151.8 kilometres (94.3 mi) of expressways. The main modes of transportation in Sri Lanka are Bus, 
                Motorcycles and Passenger Cars which are also available as Taxi. <br><br>
                The Colombo&hyphen;Matara Expressway is a 126-kilometre-long (78 mi) motorway linking Colombo, Galle and Matara which was built in 
                2011 to develop the economy of the Southern Province. The Colombo&hyphen;Katunayake Expressway, Colombo-Kandy Expressway and Outer 
                Circular Expressway (Colombo bypass road) are under construction, and a Colombo&hyphen;Padeniya expressway has been proposed. The Sri 
                Lankan government has proposed three elevated highways connecting the three main expressways:<br><br>
                Buses are the principal mode of public transport. Service is provided by the state-run Sri Lanka Transport Board (SLTB) and 
                privately owned buses. The SLTB has urban and rural routes; in many rural areas, it provides service which would be unprofitable
                 for private operators.[10] There is a website named vanuncle.lk which has been specialized to provide office transport and 
                 school transport in Sri Lanka. Many people can find an office transport very easily. <br><br>
                 Sri Lanka Railways consists of an intercity network connecting major population centres and commuter rail serving Colombo 
                 commuters. Sri Lanka Railways operates the country's railway network, which includes about 1,450 km (901 mi) of track. 
                 Colombo is its hub. Trains connect the main cities of the country's nine provinces.

              <h1 class="topic2">Culture of Sri Lanka</h1>
            <p>The culture of Sri Lanka mixes modern elements with traditional aspects and is known for its regional diversity. Sri Lankan culture
                 has long been influenced by the heritage of Theravada Buddhism passed on from India, and the religion's legacy is particularly 
                 strong in Sri Lanka's southern and central regions. South Indian cultural influences are especially pronounced in the northernmost
                  reaches of the country. The history of colonial occupation has also left a mark on Sri Lanka's identity, with Portuguese, Dutch,
                   and British elements having intermingled with various traditional facets of Sri Lankan culture. Additionally, Indonesian culture
                    has also influenced certain aspects of Sri Lankan culture. Culturally, Sri Lanka possesses strong links to both India and 
                    Southeast Asia.<br><br>
               The country has a rich artistic tradition, with distinct creative forms that encompass music, dance, and the visual arts. Sri Lankan
                culture is internationally associated with cricket, a distinct cuisine, an indigenous holistic medicine practice, religious
                 iconography such as the Buddhist flag, and exports such as tea, cinnamon, and gemstones, as well as a robust tourism industry.
                  Sri Lanka has longstanding ties with the Indian subcontinent that can be traced back to prehistory. Sri Lanka's population is
                   predominantly Sinhalese with sizable Sri Lankan Moor, Sri Lankan Tamil, Indian Tamil, Sri Lankan Malay and Burgher minorities.

              <h1 class="topic2">Tourism of Sri Lanka</h1>
            <p>The government initiatives in development of tourism date back to 1937 when the Ceylon Tourist Bureau was established. However,
                 it was closed down in September 1939 due to World War II. After Sri Lanka's independence the promotion of tourism was again 
                 considered by re-establishing the Ceylon Tourist Board which took over the function of the Tourist Bureau.<br><br>
                In 1965, J. R. Jayewardene as Minister of State initiated the first major development of the tourism industry with the Ceylon 
                Tourist Board Act No 10 of 1966 and the Ceylon Hotels Corporation Act No 14 of 1966, which formed the Ceylon Tourist Board and 
                the Ceylon Hotels Corporation. Since then the Ceylon Tourist Board has functioned as the state agency, responsible for development 
                and promotion of the tourism sector in Sri Lanka. Ceylon Hotels Corporation paved the way government investments build hotels 
                needed to attract tourist.<br><br>
                In October 2007 according to Section 2 of the Tourism Act No. 38 of 2005, the Sri Lanka Tourist Board (Act No 10 of 1966) was 
                replaced by the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority (SLTDA).<br><br>
                Currently Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority has classified Sri Lanka into several resort regions suitable for tourism
                 development. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourism_in_Sri_Lanka" class="readmore">Read More...</a>
