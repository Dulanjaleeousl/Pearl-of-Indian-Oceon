        Portuguese in the 1560s and were later rebuilt by the Dutch during 1658 and thereafter. Over the period of many centuries, interiors of these 
        forts have been largely destroyed but their ramparts and bastions still remain undamaged. History and nature lovers will truly enjoy their 
        time in some of the amazing places to visit in Mannar.
