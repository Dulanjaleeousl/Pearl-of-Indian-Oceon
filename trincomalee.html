<img src="images/Uppuveli  Beach2.jpg"  class="pic" alt="Uppuvel Beach">
<p class="p">
    Located about 10 minutes outside of Trincomalee lies the small beach village of Uppuveli. Similarly, to Nilaveli Beach, Uppuveli is a long, sandy beach with clear 
    waters and no waves. It attracts a bigger crowd than Nilaveli Beach as there is more going on in the area. However, there is more pollution and debris along the 
    shoreline and the beach itself isn&apos;t one that I would rave about.
</p>
