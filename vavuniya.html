        <h2 class="topic">Vavuniya</h2>
    <p class="p">
      Located in the Northern Province of Sri Lanka, Vavuniya is a home to several world heritage sites recognized by UNESCO. The town 
      is located about 215 km from Colombo &hyphen; capital of Sri Lanka. Vavuniya has witnessed immense turmoil during the internal wars between 
      the Sri Lankan army and the LTTE. In fact, the ravages of war still have a house in this small but bustling town. Thus, even though 
      Vavuniya does not feature frequently on the list of travelers, it is a rich and enhancing experience for the tourists nevertheless. 
      With great connectivity through road and rail, Vavuniya acts as a pitstop for those traveling to Jaffna. Apart from the places to visit 
      in Vavuniya, the local cuisine is also a crowd pleaser. If you wish to explore Sri Lanka right from its past to the present, then Vavuniya 
      should definitely be included in your itinerary.

    <h2 class="h">1. Madukanda Vihara</h2>
 
    <div class="mySlclasses fade">
      <img src="images/Madukanda Vihara3.webp"  class="pic" alt="Madukanda Vihara">
    <p class="p">
      Also known as Madukanda Sri Dalada Viharaya, Madukanda Vihara is a historic Buddhist temple. The historic religious site is located within the Madukanda 
      village, which is at a distance of 4 kilometres from Vavuniya. The Madukanda village and the sacred temple date back to at least 4th century AD. As per the 
      historians, during the journey of the holy Buddha&apos;s tooth relic, Madukanda was the 4th resting point. It also happens to be the first location where the first
      Dalada Maligaya (House of the Sacred Tooth Relic) was founded. Pilgrims who intend to follow the original trail often stop at Madukanda Vihara for rest. Madukanda 
      Vihara is the relic house where the sacred tooth was venerated until the temple in Anuradhapura was built. One can witness fine craftsmanship in the form of 
      intricate carvings made on the granite stepping stones. In addition to the temple, one can even visit the Stupa nearby which lacks the adornments as 
      compared to the Vihara but is of equal historical value. As per a local legend, the giant Nandimithra, a top ranking official in King Dutugamunu&apos;s army was 
      born here. Also, one can also visit the former residence, Madukanda Walawwa of a famous Sinhalese chieftain who lived there during the British reign. Traveling 
      to the Madukanda Vihara is easy. Getting to central Vavuniya costs about Rs. 250 for a ride on a three-wheeler. Additionally, the temple offers free accommodation 
      and basic amenities to those visiting the Madukanda Vihara.

      <img src="images/Kandasamy Kovil1.jpg"  class="pic" alt="Kandasamy Kovil">
    <p class="p">
      If religion fascinates you and you wish to see the impression of Hindu architecture on Sri Lanka, then you should consider visiting the Kandasamy 
      Kovil. The temple&apos;s vibrantly decorated facade will have you believe that you are traveling in South India. The faded, yet interesting temple gateway 
      tower (gopuram) along with the idol decorated in gold and placed in the sanctum will leave architecture lovers delighted. Murugan (or Lord Kartikeya) is the 
      primary deity in this Hindu temple. In addition to being a place of worship, the Kandasamy Kovil temple also has a wedding hall where people can hold 
      marriage ceremonies. The temple is often crowded during major Hindu festivals. Unfortunately, getting a good view of the temple can be marred by many obstacles 
      and therefore you may have to walk through the entire temple complex to have a good look around.

    <h2 class="h">3. Archeological Museum of Vavuniya</h2>
      <img src="images/Archeological Museum of Vavuniya3.jpg"  class="pic" alt="Archeological Museum of Vavuniya">
    <p class="p">
      The Archeological Museum of Vavuniya is founded, owned, and maintained by the Department of Archeology of Sri Lanka. Unlike its counterparts from the 
      ancient cities, the museum happens to have a modest collection of several antiques. Since it is a a regional museum, it only holds items that were 
      found in or around Vavuniya. If you are merely a tourist without much interest in the museum articles, you may enjoy resting in the shady yard of 
      the Archeological Museum of Vavuniya. On the other hand, history buffs will get excited on seeing the 4th century and 5th-century relics in the form of 
      the pinched face terracotta figurines that are remnants of the Kilinochchi. The hexagonal chamber in the center contains 5th and 8th century Buddha 
      statues made from Mannar limestone. Furthermore, idols of Hindu goddesses and even some Christian elements like the baptismal font are also displayed 
      here. Entry to the Archeological Museum of Vavuniya is free and do bear in mind that photography is allowed only after gaining prior permission.

      <img src="images/Grand Jummah Mosque2.jpg"  class="pic" alt="Grand Jummah Mosque">
    <p class="p">
      Located in the heart of the town, the Grand Jummah Mosque towers over the busy market with its sparkling onion-shaped golden domes. The fresh aqua 
      tinted tiles decorating the exteriors make the creation stand out remarkably, especially consclassering that most traditional mosques are white in color. It is 
      a major place of worship for the Muslims. The heart of Islam witnesses a large amount of activity of all those wishing to practice their faith.

      <img src="images/St.-Anthony_u2019s-Church.webp"  class="pic" alt="St. Anthonys Church">
    <p class="p">
      St. Anthony&apos;s Church is located on the Horowpotana road in Vavuniya. Although the construction of the church is rather plain, the stunning view 
      of the lake accentuates the beauty in its simplicity. The Church is beautifully decorated during Christmas and New Year.

    <h2 class="h">6. Kaludiya Pokuna Forest</h2>
      <img src="images/Kaludiya Pokuna Forest1.webp"  class="pic" alt="Kaludiya Pokuna Forest">
    <p class="p">
       Nature lovers can relax and enjoy the true bounties of Mother Earth in the Kaludiya Pokuna Forest. The lush forest houses an array of diverse species that are 
       non-endemic and endemic to Sri Lanka. Despite the presence of a human settlement around the forest, the woodland happens to be untouched by man-made activities.
       Primates, especially the purple-faced langoor and the tufted grey langoor, can be primarily found here. Trees having high timber value are also seen flourishing 
       here without any human interference. Apart from the thriving flora and fauna, one will also stumble upon ancient ruins and remains of Kaludiya Pokuna.

    <div class="mySlclasses seven fade">
      <img src="images/Isinbassagala2.jpg"  class="pic" alt="Isinbassagala">
    <p class="p">
       Isinbassagala is an offbeat tourist location that is about 21.4 kilometres away from the center of Vavuniya. Perched on a hill, the grand Stupa and the Buddha 
       temple offer a panoramic view of the rolling landscapes available all around. One can see giant statues of King Devanampiyatissa and Lord Buddha along with the 
       Bodhi tree. This temple was commissioned by the King Devanampiyatissa and the original structure has been renovated and repaired in the 20th century. 
       In addition to the temple remains, a cobra-carved stone (Naga Gala) and footprints of Lord Buddha were also discovered during the excavations at this site. 
       These discoveries point out the different epochs of time in Sri Lankan history. Before the doctrine of Buddha was heavily practised, Nagas (Cobra) were the prime deity.

    <h2 class="h">8. Wasgamuwa National Park</h2>
      <img src="images/Wasgamuwa National Park.jpg"  class="pic" alt="Wasgamuwa National Park">
    <p class="p">
       One will have to travel about 75 kilometres from Vavuniya to reach the Wasgamuwa National Park located in Polonnaruwa district but it will be totally worth the 
       effort. The natural reserve of Wasgamuwa National Park harbors untamed wildlife and you can view herds of buffaloes and elephants freely roaming around the 
       vicinity. Considering that the influx of tourists is pretty slim at the Wasgamuwa National Park, the region is never crowded. Owing to the less commercialization, 
       visitors can truly enjoy a genuine safari visit.
